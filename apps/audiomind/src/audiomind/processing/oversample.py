"""Reusable polyphase oversampling for nonlinear DSP stages.

Oversampling raises the Nyquist frequency of the working signal so that
nonlinearities (limiting, clipping, saturation) generate far fewer in-band
aliasing products. Both directions use the SAME matched windowed-sinc FIR
through :func:`scipy.signal.resample_poly`, which keeps the up/down pair
complementary: upsampling and then downsampling with identical filters
returns a signal of the original length on the original grid.

Window choice — ``("kaiser", 8.6)``:
  ``resample_poly`` builds a polyphase anti-aliasing FIR from a windowed
  sinc (``sinc(2*fc*n)``, ``fc = 1/factor``) tapered by the requested
  Kaiser window. A Kaiser beta of 8.6 yields ~80 dB stopband attenuation,
  i.e. interpolation images and aliases land at least ~80 dB below the
  passband — well below the ~ -60 dBFS noise floor of a 16-bit master,
  while keeping the filter short enough (a few ``factor`` taps) to stay
  cheap at 8x oversampling. Higher betas sharpen the cutoff at the cost of
  longer filters; 8.6 is the standard "quality" point (the default used by
  most pro-audio resamplers).

Usage:
  Sprint 2 (True Peak Limiter) oversamples 8x through these helpers.
  Sprint 3 (Clipper) reuses the same module at 16x.
