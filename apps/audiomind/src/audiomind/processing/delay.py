"""Feedback delay (Sprint 10 — circular-buffer time delay, opt-in insert).

A delay with feedback is the simplest time-based effect and the foundation
for echo and reverb: the dry signal is summed with its own history, shifted
by ``time_ms``, and the delayed output loops back into the delay line. The
dry/wet balance is set by ``mix`` and the number of repeats by ``feedback``:

    y[n] = dry·(1 − mix) + wet[n]·mix
    wet[n] = x[n − d] + fb·wet[n − d]        (feedback delay line)

where ``d = round(sr · time_ms / 1000)`` samples. Expanding the recursion,
the wet signal is a geometric series over the delay line's own history:

    wet[n] = Σ_k fb^(k−1) · x[n − k·d]

The line is implemented as a CIRCULAR BUFFER in closed form. Instead of a
sample-by-sample pointer loop, each pass through the buffer (one tap, lag
``k·d``) is accumulated directly from the input with weight ``fb^(k−1)`` —
mathematically identical to the circular-buffer recursion, but vectorized.
With ``fb == 0.0`` the series has exactly one term: the single-repeat delay
the contract describes. The tail is truncated once the repeat gain falls
below ``TAP_GAIN_FLOOR`` (−60 dB of the first repeat), which is inaudible
and bounds the cost on long masters.

Neutral mode: ``mix == 0.0`` is a bit-exact no-op (the pass is skipped and
the input returned untouched, so the wet path is never even computed). The
engine inserts this stage gated by ``params.delay_enabled`` with mix-0.0
defaults, so existing masters pass through unchanged unless the mix moves —
even with the stage enabled, moving ``time_ms``/``feedback`` alone (mix
still 0.0) leaves the signal bit-identical.

Processing is float64, per-channel (identical channels initialize identical
delay lines and stay identical), with input shape and dtype preserved; mono
(1-D) and stereo (channels, samples) are handled like the tape module.
