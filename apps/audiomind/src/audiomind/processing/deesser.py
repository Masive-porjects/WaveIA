"""Dynamic de-esser (Phase B — sibilance 3-8 kHz in the master chain).

The legacy sibilance treatment (``vocal.py``) is STATIC and lives only in
the /vocal path: a fixed -12 dB peak cut at 7.2 kHz blended by a constant
amount. This module adds a DYNAMIC master-chain de-esser: the 3-8 kHz
"ess" band is only attenuated while sibilance is actually present, and the
reduction ramps in/out with attack/release smoothing so the master never
"pumps" on consecutive sibilants.

Band — 3-8 kHz, anchored on the existing analysis band table
(``TARGET_BANDS_HZ``: presence = 6 kHz, air = 10 kHz) and the vocal-path
de-esser (5-8 kHz, center 7.2 kHz). The 3-8 kHz window spans upper-mids
to presence, where fricatives ("s", "ch", "sh") concentrate their noise.

Detector — the energy ratio of the sibilance band vs the broadband
signal: ``ratio_db = band_env_db - total_env_db`` with the shared one-pole
attack/release envelope (``multiband.detect_envelope``, 15 ms / 150 ms).
A sibilant burst concentrates most of the frame's energy into the band
(ratio → ≈0 dB); a clean tone leaves the band near its noise floor (ratio
→ very negative).

A ratio detector alone would dull a permanently-bright program (hi-hat
heavy or sibilant-by-design mixes keep the ratio high constantly), so the
reduction is gated by TWO further conditions (``_detection_gate``):

  * the band must be AUDIBLE (``band_db > -55 dBFS``) — silence/noise
    floors never pump the gain, and
  * the band must SPIKE above its own rolling reference level (a slow
    one-pole average, 500 ms): sibilance is a TRANSIENT event on top of
    the program's average band level, so a band that sits permanently at
    its reference (bright pads, hats, sizzle) stays untouched.

Gain computer — linear ramp ``gr_db = -amount_db * clip(excess/range, 0, 1)``
over a 10 dB detector range: threshold → no cut, threshold + 10 dB → the
full ``amount_db`` cut. Cuts only; below threshold the band contributes
exactly 0 dB (bit-exact no-op on clean material).

Topology — the band is isolated with a 4th-order Butterworth band-pass
(``scipy.signal.butter``, 24 dB/oct), and the output is the parallel
attenuation ``y = x + (g_lin - 1) * x_band`` — exactly at ``g_lin = 1``
the contribution is zero, so a below-threshold pass can short-circuit to
the untouched input (bit-exact), mirroring the static-EQ discipline of
``dyn_eq.py``.

Neutral mode: ``amount_db == 0`` (or the engine gate ``deesser_enabled``
off) makes the stage a bit-exact no-op. The engine inserts this stage
gated by ``params.deesser_enabled`` right after gain staging — BEFORE the
tonal/dynamics chain — so existing masters pass through unchanged.
