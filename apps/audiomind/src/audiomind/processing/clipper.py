"""16x oversampled soft-clipper (Sprint 3 — KClip/Ozone-style transient shaver).

Clipping generates harmonics; a hard or lightly-oversampled clip aliases them
back in-band. This clipper runs the shaper at 16x the input rate (via the
reusable :mod:`audiomind.processing.oversample` FIR pair) and applies a smooth
piecewise curve, so the delivered master's in-band aliasing stays below
``-90 dBFS`` for a full-scale 20 kHz sine.

Why 16x (roadmap corrected): at 4x the 9th harmonic of a 20 kHz full-scale
sine folds in-band at 3.6 kHz and no 4x filter can remove it — the floor for
any engaged clipper is ~ -60 to -65 dBFS. At 8x it moves to the 17th harmonic
fold (~ -87 dBFS). Only 16x (35th-harmonic fold, ~ -108 dBFS) reaches the
-90 dBFS pro standard with margin.

Shaper — piecewise erf knee:
  ``y(r) = r``                                    for ``|r| <= thr``
  ``y(r) = thr + (1 - thr) * erf(a*(r-thr)/(1-thr))``  for ``|r| > thr``

with ``a = sqrt(pi)/2`` so the slope matches the linear zone exactly at the
knee. ``erf`` is C-infinity, concave above the knee, and asymptotes to the
0 dBFS ceiling without any hard cap — fast harmonic roll-off (the key to low
aliasing) and no discontinuities. Below the threshold the curve is exactly
``y = x``: material that never reaches the knee is returned bit-identical
(bit-stable null path).

Placement: BEFORE the true-peak limiter. The clipper trims transient peaks
(2-4 dB) with controlled, band-safe distortion; the limiter then only has to
sustain the body — the KClip/Ozone "modern loudness" trick.

The sample rate is accepted for API parity with :func:`true_peak_limit`; the
memoryless shaper is sample-rate independent (the FIR cutoff is always
``sr/2`` at any rate).
