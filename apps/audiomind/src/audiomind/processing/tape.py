"""Real tape saturation model (Sprint 7 — hysteresis + level-dependent HF roll-off).

A real tape recorder is NOT a tanh. The Sprint 7 roadmap calls out the three
properties the normalized-tanh stage (``_apply_saturation(..., "tape")``) is
missing: MAGNETIC MEMORY (the reproduced output depends on its own recent
history), LEVEL-DEPENDENT HIGH-FREQUENCY LOSS (short wavelengths saturate on
the tape before long ones do, so loud highs are compressed without turning
harsh) and GENTLE ASYMMETRY (the bias current offsets the operating point,
so even harmonics mix with the tanh's odd ones). This module implements all
three around the roadmap's recursive state shaper.

Shaper — the roadmap hysteresis recursion (soft saturation with memory):

    y[n] = tanh(drive·x[n] + bias + k·y[n−1]·(1 − |y[n−1]|))

where ``drive = 10**(drive_db/20)`` pushes the biased input into the tanh.
The ``k·y[n−1]·(1 − |y[n−1]|)`` term is the hysteretic feedback: it is
strongest mid-swing (|y| = 0.5 gives y·(1−|y|) = 0.25) and vanishes at the
rails (|y| → 1), so the tape "remembers" the recent excursion exactly where
it matters. The feedback is bounded by k/4, the tanh clips it, and the
output is therefore bounded by ±1 for every input — the recursion cannot
blow up. ``hysteresis == 0.0`` disables the recursive term and the shaper
reduces to a plain soft clip.

Asymmetry — the DC ``bias`` (≤ 0.2, "gentle") offsets the operating point
into the tanh, so positive and negative half-cycles compress unequally and
even harmonics (2nd, 4th, …) are added to the tanh's odd set. With
``bias == 0.0`` the shaper is exactly odd (tanh(0) = 0), which is the
roadmap's "pre-emphasis + bias": the HF pre-emphasis of a real tape deck is
deliberately OMITTED here because the level-dependent roll-off below already
covers the HF behavior more directly, and a static pre-emphasis would color
the drive-only path (breaking its "pure drive" identity).

Level-dependent HF roll-off — after the shaper, a static 2nd-order
Butterworth low-pass at ``hf_shelf_hz`` (the roadmap's "progressive
roll-off") is mixed in proportion to a smoothed pre-shaping level:

    level = one-pole peak envelope of |drive·x + bias|          (dB)
    blend = rolloff_amount · clip((level_db − LOW)/(HIGH − LOW), 0, 1)²
    y     = y_sat·(1 − blend) + lowpass(y_sat)·blend

The level is measured on the PRE-shaping flux (drive · input), so a higher
drive means a higher detected level means MORE high-frequency roll-off —
monotonic, level-dependent HF reduction (brightness without harshness).
Below the blend knee the stage is transparent; ``rolloff_amount == 0.0``
disables the mixing entirely.

Neutral mode: with ``drive_db == 0.0``, ``hysteresis == 0.0``,
``bias == 0.0`` and ``rolloff_amount == 0.0`` the stage is a bit-exact no-op
(the recursive shaper can never reproduce the input, so the pass is
skipped). The engine inserts this stage gated by ``params.tape_enabled``
with these defaults, so existing masters pass through unchanged and the
legacy tanh path stays active until the model is engaged.

Acceptance mapping (roadmap): sine spectral analysis → BOTH even (bias
asymmetry) and odd (tanh) harmonics present; frequency response with high
drive shows progressive, monotonic, level-dependent HF roll-off; bypass
null test → bit-exact.

Processing is float64 with per-channel stateful recursion (identical
channels initialize their state identically and stay identical); the input
shape and dtype are preserved. NOTE: the shaper recursion is sample-by-
sample Python (like the legacy ``_apply_saturation``), which is exact but
not fast; a vectorized/Cython pass is a possible follow-up.
