"""True Peak Limiter with 8x oversampling, explicit lookahead and adaptive release.

Prevents inter-sample clipping that occurs during D/A conversion and
lossy codec encoding (MP3, AAC, OGG).

The sampled peak lies: the true inter-sample peak of a digital signal can
exceed the largest sample by up to ~3 dB. This limiter therefore enforces
its ceiling on an 8x oversampled copy of the signal (via the reusable
``audiomind.processing.oversample`` FIR pair), so the delivered master
never exceeds the requested dBTP ceiling.

Architecture (standard pro-limiter topology):
  - Stage 1 — the sustained "body" limiter with a long, PROGRAM-DEPENDENT
    release. The release is picked from the input crest factor
    (:func:`calculate_crest_factor`): high crest (percussive material)
    selects a short release, low crest (dense tails/pads) a long one.
  - Stage 2 — the transient catcher: a fast lookahead limiter (L = 4 ms,
    ~30 ms release) that bounds any edge the slow stage lets through.
  - Hard clipper at 0 dBFS as the final safety net.

The lookahead is explicit and time-aligned. For every output sample the
gain is computed from a window that LOOKS AHEAD ``L`` samples, and that
gain is applied to the current sample::

    y[n] = x[n] * g[n]
    g[n] = min(1, c / max|x[n .. n+L]|, g[n-1] * decay)

where ``c`` is the ceiling in linear and ``decay`` is the per-sample
exponential release factor. Because the future window pre-attenuates
transients (instead of overshooting them), the ceiling is enforced without
clicking, the output stays time-aligned with the input, and the output
length equals the input length. Below the ceiling the gain is exactly 1 and
the limiter returns the input untouched (bit-stable null behavior).

Includes:
  - Codec pre-matching: automatically lowers ceiling for loud,
    heavily compressed tracks to prevent inter-sample clipping
    during lossy encoding (Spotify, Apple Music).
  - Crest factor analysis for dynamic ceiling decisions.

Target: -14 LUFS integrated with adaptive ceiling (-1.0 to -2.0 dBTP).
